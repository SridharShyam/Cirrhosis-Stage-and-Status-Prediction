# Predicting-Cirrhosis-Stage-and-Cirrhotic-Patient-Status

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict both the disease stage and patient status based on clinical data. It aims to assist digital healthcare systems in making faster and more accurate decisions, contributing to efficient patient care and treatment planning.

## Dataset Information:

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes key clinical features such as age, bilirubin, albumin levels, and the presence of ascites, which are critical in diagnosing liver diseases.

Task 1: Predicting the disease stage (early to advanced).
Task 2: Predicting patient status (e.g., Alive, Deceased).

## Project Workflow:

### Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, normalized features, and prepared the data for modeling.

### Feature Selection:

Identified the most relevant features to enhance predictive performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed trends across features (e.g., bilirubin, age distribution).
Visualized correlations between variables.

### Model Building:

Stage Prediction Model: Predicts disease progression stage.
Status Prediction Model: Classifies patients based on survival status.

### Evaluation:

Employed classification reports and accuracy scores for insights.

## Results & Insights:

### Disease Stage Prediction Accuracy(approx): 53.5%
### Patient Status Prediction Accuracy(approx): 84%
The models offer practical insights into patient care by accurately identifying stages and outcomes, enabling proactive medical decisions.

## Challenges and Future Work:

### Challenge: 
Balancing the accuracy of both stage and status models, as some patients might show unexpected outcomes (e.g., recovery in advanced stages).

### Future Work:
Incorporate additional data to improve predictions.
Explore more sophisticated models like ensemble techniques.
Deploy the models into a clinical application for real-world use.

## Visualizations:

### Heatmap:
Showed feature correlations for better understanding of key predictors.
### Pie Chart:
Illustrated the distribution of patient statuses.
### Bar Plot:
Compared the modelsâ€™ performance metrics visually.
